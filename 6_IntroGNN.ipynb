    "A graph consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges, where edges form connections\n",
    "between nodes. More formally, a graph is a pair $ \\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V},\n",
    "\\mathcal{E})$ where $\\mathcal{V}$ is the set of vertices / nodes, and $\\mathcal{E}$ is\n",
    "the set of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an **undirected** graph, each edge is an unordered pair of two nodes $ \\in\n",
    "\\mathcal{V}$. E.g. a friend network can be represented as an undirected graph, assuming\n",
    "that the relationship \"*A is friends with B*\" implies \"*B is friends with A*\". In a\n",
    "**directed** graph (or **digraph**), each edge is an ordered pair of nodes $ \\in \\mathcal{V}$. E.g. a\n",
    "citation network would be best represented with a directed graph, since the relationship\n",
    "\"*A cites B*\" does not imply \"*B cites A*\".\n",

    "The **degree** of a node is defined as the number of edges incident on it, i.e. the sum\n",

    "There are several ways to represent $\\mathcal{E}$:\n",
    "1. As a **list of edges**: a list of pairs $(u,v)$, where $(u,v)$ means that there is an edge going from node $u$ to node $v$.\n",
    "2. As an **adjacency matrix**: a binary square matrix $A$ of size $|\\mathcal{V}| \\times |\\mathcal{V}|$, where $A_{u,v}=1$ iff there is a connection between nodes $u$ and $v$.\n",
    "3. As an **adjacency list**: An array of $|\\mathcal{V}|$ unordered lists, where the\n",

    "architectures. \n",

    "GCNs have some analogies with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In a CNN, a convolutional filter (e.g. 3x3) is applied\n",
    "repeatedly to different parts of a larger input (e.g. 64x64) by striding across the\n",

    "a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are also some differences to point out:\n",
    "In contrast to the CNN filter, the neighbourhoods in a GCN can be of different sizes, and there is no ordering of inputs. To see that, note that the CNN filter performs a weighted sum aggregation over the inputs with learnable weights, where each filter input has its own weight. In the GCN, the same weight is applied to all neighbours and the aggregation function is not learned. In other words, in a GCN, each neighbor contributes equally. This is why the CNN filter is not order-invariant, but the GCN filter is.\n",

    "1. _Compute messages_ : Apply a linear transformation with weights\n",
